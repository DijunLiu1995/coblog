how co-attention affect beta
consists of 3 data: 1. monthly 2. weekly 3. announce, potentially for 3 papers.
        expand can get the 3 month discussion before by 'from to', but scale by 12 month total stk coverage is too long, he might already changed the portfolio.
        But all this is guessing, since we can't know the real composite porfolio structure of the investor.
Dist_stk is not well represented either, since the actual stks is unknown.But for the stk in our initial sample, from Dist_stk_month/Dist_stk_yr=.63 we can know the pattern  it is not diversified.
每年每个用户多少个月份有关注 dist_month_user, avg=1.3, p50=1, Distinct co-attention stks for each stk is 43 on avg, median is 3. So there are some extreme investors.

Detrend can't decompose the co-attention, since attention always induce co-attention. the ratio co_p_r may do.

Volume detrend as in Barber 2008, but only test for weekly data
